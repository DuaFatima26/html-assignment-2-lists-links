    <h1><strong>Lets Leran About The Lists In HTML:</strong></h1>
    <p>There are lots of occasions when we
        need to use lists. HTML provides us with
        three different types:
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong><i>
                    <h3>*ORDERED LIST:</h3>
                </i></strong></dt>
        <dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ordered
            lists are lists where each item in the list is
            numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for
            a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract
            where each point needs to be identified by a section
            number.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>Folliwng are the some examples of <b>Ordered list:</b></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Shershah </li>
        <li>Bajirao Mastani</li>
        <li>Actor in law</li>
        <li>Gangs of wasseypur</li>
        <li>Mughal-E-Azam</li>
    </ol>

    <dl>
        <dt><em><b>
                    <h3>*UNORDERED LIST OR BULLETED LIST:</h3>
                </b></em></dt>
        <dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unordered
            list are lists that begin with a bullet point
            (rather than characters that indicate order).</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>Following are the some examples of <b>Unordered list:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Saudia Arabia</li>
        <li>Duabi</li>
        <li>America</li>
        <li>London</li>

        <dd>Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the
            definitions for each of those terms.</dd>

        <dt><b><em>WEB DEVELOPMENT:</em></b></dt>
        <dd>Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet or an intranet. Web
            development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications,
            electronic businesses, and social network services.</dd>
        <dt><b><em>JAVASCRIPT:</em></b></dt>
        <dd>JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted (or just-in-time compiled) programming language with
            first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser
            environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat.</dd>
        <dt><b><em>CSS:</em></b></dt>
        <dd>Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a
            document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide
            Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</dd>
        <dt><b><em>C++:</em></b></dt>
        <dd>C++ is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language that is viewed by many as the best language for
            creating large-scale applications. C++ is a superset of the C language. A related programming language,
            Java, is based on C++ but optimized for the distribution of program objects in a network such as the
            internet.</dd>
        <dt><b><em>PYTHON PROGRAMMING:</em></b></dt>
        <dd>Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code
            readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It
            supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured, object-oriented and functional programming

                    <h3>*NESTED LIST:</h3>
                </em></b></dt>
        <dd>A nested list is a list inside another list. You can create a nested unordered list, or a nested ordered
            list, or even an ordered list nested inside an unordered one. Remember that the only direct child of the ul
            tag is li .</dd>

    <p>The example of <b>Nested list</b>is given below:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Vegetables </li>
        <li>Dry fruits</li>
        <ol>Fruits
            <li>Banana</li>
            <li>Apple</li>
            <li>Mango</li>
            <li>Grapes</li>
            <li>Peach</li>

        <li>Bakery items</li>

        <h1>WHAT ARE ABSOLUTE URLs<sub>External links or websites</sub>?</h1>
    </center>
    <p>HTML provides us two kinds of links for viewers:</p>
    <p><b>1.Absolute URLs</b></p>
    <p><b>2.Relative URLs</b></p>
    <p>Links are created using the <a> element. Users can click on anything
            between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag. You specify
            which page you want to link to using the href attribute.</p>

    <h4>*LETS DISCUSS ABOUT ABSOLUTE URLs:</h4>

            <h3>ABSOLUTE URLs</h3>
        </b></center>
    <center>An absolute URL is the full URL, including protocol ( http / https ), the optional subdomain (e.g. www ),
        domain ( example.com ), and path (which includes the directory and slug). Absolute URLs provide all the
        available information to find the location of a page.</center>

    </center>
    <p>JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology of the Web, alongside HTML and
        CSS. 99% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior. Web browsers have a dedicated
        JavaScript engine that executes the client code</p>
